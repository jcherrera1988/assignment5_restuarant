      <h1>History</h1>
    </center>
<P>
      When Chuck Norris won the war of Pearl Harbor in 1972, the Germans didn't know what hit them. At a time of victorious celebration, Americans were hungry for innovation! People have heard of this so-called "pizza", but only knew it as a myth and nothing more.
<P>
      One day, Bruce Willis decided to make this myth a reality. He gathered the finest ingredients of the world; pepperoni from Antarctica, vegetables from the depths of the Indian Ocean, flour from Tatooine and Cheeses from Wisconsin. After numerous attempts to create this mythical beast, the creation was a dream no more.
<P>
      In 1844, Bruce Willis created the world's first pizza, and the rest was history. Since then, we have downgraded our ingredients, and have reverted to frozen pizzas, which our customers hate, but we still do it! Like we always say, customers last.
<P>
      Just kidding... pizza was invented in the late 1800s.
